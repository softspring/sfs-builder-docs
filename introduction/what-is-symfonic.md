# What is Symfonic?

Symfonic is a powerful content management system (CMS) thanks to which you can create and manage static pages of your website from a single place, simplifying the work process, and also the life of the developers.

Symfonic is our made at home CMS solution that we have designed to integrate with Symfony, the well-known PHP framework (and also our favorite).

## Why another CMS? {#why-another-cms}

We have been working with Symfony for a long time, and we have tried many CMS systems, but we have not found any that meets our needs.

We have decided to create our own CMS system, based on Symfony, and we want to share it with the community.

## Why Symfony? {#why-symfony}

Symfony is a powerful framework, with a large community and a lot of bundles and components that can be used to build any kind of project.

It's a great choice for any project, and it's the perfect choice for a CMS system.

Symfony is fast, secure, and easy to use, and allows you to build complex projects in a short time.

It's a long term solution, they have been working on it for more than 10 years with an excellent support, has a large community, and is used by many big companies to build their projects.
