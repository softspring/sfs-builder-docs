# Previewing and publishing a page

Once all the content has been created, we can see how it will look like once published, to do this we can go to the top right of the page and in the **drop-down Save version click on save and preview**.

From here we can return to edit the page (**Edit version**) if we have to change or add something. Once we are sure, it is time to publish.

We can publish from the preview by clicking on **Publish version** or from the edition by clicking on **Save and publish**.

Each time we publish a version, if we make a mistake we can go back to previous versions. 

>> We can see all versions in the display of a page, **Versions tab**.
